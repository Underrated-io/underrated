        <h1 class="h1">No, Zombies Are Not Your Friends, & Do Not Believe Them Even If They Say They Are</h1>
        
        <i>Alexander Boople</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It may be surprising to you, but zombies are *not* your friends.
            They may seem nice and may moan at you from the lips of your
            loved ones, but they are only trying to lull you into a false
            sense of security.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            They know they look like your long dead Uncle Ernie
            and that you left your admiration for his pickle jar
            collection unsaid before his untimely reanimation.
            But this is how they trick you.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            They get you to think that _maybe_ some part of the Aunt Mildred,
            who baked you cookies every day after school when all the other
            PhD candidates called your work silly and foolish and
            told you you‘d never amount to anything more than an untenured
            adjunct, is still in there and just might start baking again at
            any moment if you’d just come within arm’s reach.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            They want you to feel that maybe, just maybe that girl down the
            street who beat you up every single day of your adult life will
            finally realize that you are much cooler than your pocket protector
            makes you out to be. That she will finally embrace you for the
            wonderful person that you are and stop telling her friends that you
            smell like an uncomplimentary mix of eggs and old-person ointment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Do not believe them!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            They lie!!!!!!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            They only want to eat your brains and possibly elevate their apocalyptic
            social standing by bringing more zombies into the horde.
            You are *not* your misguided wishes for love and affection.
            You are a person with thoughts and hopes and dreams.
            Don’t throw them away by trusting some infected guy from your hometown
            who was the epitome of cool and now says through his moans that he wants
            to be your friend. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Stay strong, Alexander—I mean, _yooou_. Just because he’s shown up to finally
            tell you he was wrong for giving you atomic wedgies and telling everyone that
            you wet your pants in eighth grade and that’s what you’ve longed for every
            moment since high school ended doesn’t mean that it has happened or that he
            doesn’t have ulterior motives.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hey, Brad, what are you doing—
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It’s true?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            You want to tell everyone you’re my best friend?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Why, yes, I will gladly come within arm’s reach to hear what you are mumbling…
        </p>
