                <p>
                    It may be surprising to you, but zombies are <b>not</b> your friends.
                    They may seem nice and may moan at you from the lips of your love ones,
                    but they are only trying to lull you into a false sense of security
                </p>
                <p>
                    They know they look like your long dead Uncle Ernie and 
                    that you left your admiration for his pickle jar collection
                    unsaid before his untimely reanimation. But this is how they
                    trick you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They get you to think that <em>maybe</em> some part of the Aunt Mildred,
                    who baked you cookies every day after school when all the other PhD
                    candidates called your work silly and foolish and told you you'd
                    never amount to anything more than an untenured adjunct, is still in
                    there and just might start baking again at any moment if you'd
                    just come within arms reach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They want you to feel that maybe, just maybe that girl down the street who
                    beat you up every single day of your adult life will finally realize
                    that you are much cooler that your pocket protector makes you out to be.
                    That she will finally embrace you for the wonderful peson that you
                    are and stop telling her friends that you smell like an uncomplimentary
                    mix of eggs and old-person ointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do not believe them!
                </p>
                <p>
                    They lie!!!!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    They only want to eat your brains and possibly elevate their apocalyptic
                    social standing by bringing more zombies into the horde.
                    You are <b>not</b> your misguided wishes for love and affection.
                    You are a person with thoughts and hopes and dreams. Don't throw
                    them away by trusting some infected guy from your hometown who
                    was the epitome of coll and now says through his moans that he wants to be your friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stay strong Alexander-I mean, <i>yooou</i>. Just because he's
                    shown up to fnally tell you he was wrong for giving you atomic wedgies
                    and telling everyone that you wet your pants in eight grde and that's
                    what you've longed for every moment since high school ended dosen't
                    mean that it has happened or that he dosen't have ulterior motives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hey, Brad, what are you doing-
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's true?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You want to tell everyone you're my best friend?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why, yes, I will gladly come within arm's reach to hear what
                    you're mumbling...
                </p>
