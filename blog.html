            <p id="para1">Hello World</p>
            <p id="para1">Welcome to Stones Inc&copy;</p>
            <p>Well this is a dummy website for my intended company, so basically its just bunch of rookie codes and hoping it works out lol.</p>
            <p class="center">Welcome to my first webpage</p>
            <p>
                This is the CEO Stones Group, actually its stones inc but i'm hoping i can delve into other industries like fashion,aviation,oil and the likes.<br>
                But most especially fashion, why fashion some might ask (that's if anybody ever ready this and asks why fashion lol), i'm actually inspired by Kanye West otherwise known as"YE" CEO of the YEZZY brand.<br>
                In his previous marriage with Kim kardashian, he mostly did style his wife (wtf am i even talking about sef lol)... he was...well...think about it...scrr..scrr...scrr...scratch that...well to me he had quite a unique fashion sense.<br>
                i dunno what to say atm lol, maybe we'll come back to this.<br>
                but for now this would be a blog website.<br>
                Let's talk about me then...<br>
            </p>
            <h3>About the CEO</h3>
            <p>
            My Name Is <b>JASPER STONES</b>
            I am a citizen of a  Happy Place, a fantasy world in my head
            i've alwasy wanted to be a scientist to find the cure of AIDS, but then i found an enemy in chemistry, couldn't bring myself to understand these chemicals or remember those formulas, i couldn't bring myself to do shit on chemistry bloody fuck!.<br>
            So along the line trying be on a mutual understanding with my enemy chemistry, yunno scratch my back i scratch yours type shit lol, i completed highschool finally.<br>
            During the pandemic that affected the world, well your world your earth lol, i mean c'mon i stay in a happy place do you think id exprience a pandemic in a happy place?<br>
            NO! of course. So on a faithful anyday lol i had an eureka moment why don't I learn how to hack, maybe i could shut down one of your popular social media app for a week, while their IT dept. scrambles day in day out to fix it lol...<br>
            Long story short cos i'm getting tired of typing as it is lol, i've had lots of dreams, i've wanted to be lots of things sadly i don't have the drive to be anybody in life.<br>
            But i promise yall future readers and users of this upcoming blog of mine, i'd add hyperlinks to each gaps in this write-up so you can get an indept insight of the life of CEO STONES INC/GROUP<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Want to learn how to create your own website?</h3>
            <p>
                One of the first things i had to do so i could achieve and garner some level of knowledge and information in coding is starting first.
                come on folks just start first then all other things would align, the saying goes "A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES BEGINS WITH ONE STEP", in truth when you make the saying practical theres no lies in it.
                just fucking start people and whatever it is you want you'd get.<br>
                Back to business, one of the first things to understand when trying to create a website is HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language).<br>
                I myself is just learning but this blog is a proof of my progress lol, but it seems i might not host this webpage till im near perfect, so y'all might not see the early days of this website.
            </p>
            <p>What if i include screenshots of the early days of the webpage</p>
            Here is an example of what the web page would looks like right now on a browser:<br>
            <input type="checkbox" id="img-toggle" hidden>
            <label for="img-toggle">
                <img src="Screenshot of webpage.png" alt="First Webpage Design of STONES INC&copy;" class="expand-img">
            </label>
    
            <p>This is the first look of the webpage, theres more underway<br>
                I'd be sharing every progress of the blog creation
            </p>
            Jasper Stones here Again and i just created the login page for the blogsite<br>
            here is an image of it below<br>
            <input type="checkbox" id="img-toggle" hidden>
            <label>
                <img src="Screenshot of loginpage.png" alt="First Login-page desige for STONES INC&copy;" class="expand-img">
            </label>
    
            <P><h3>07/01/2026</h3> i figured i should start by dating each steps and milestones of this website,
                so it can be traced to its earliest design and understood<br>
                i started this website on the <b><u>06/01/2026</u></b>, by the way this isn't my first webpage project, but it is my first improved and deep-rooted web project.
                before i go into another round of rambling, i just update the login page with a better background :). Screenshot below :
                <label for="img-toggle">
                <img src="updated loginpage.png" alt="Updated Loginpage Design of STONES INC&copy;" class="expand-img">
            </label>
            </P>
            <p>
                Hello there, its me again. I just moved this blog from its initial website to this, this would now be the dummy website for STONES INC&copy;<br>
                this new site was created yesterday to really understand in details how a webpage works.
                So, i'd probably host this webpage in the nearest future to see how it'll do in real-time, but for now i only understand how to create a webpage using traditional HTML and CSS.<br>
                And i'm learning <b>PYTHON</b> also by the side, with the hope of creating a simple game soon to host also on this webpage.<br>
                Well that's by the way, let's talk about something else, maybe about books i've read and maybe movies and tv-shows i've watched. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've watched lot's of movies and read lot's of book, sadly i can't remember all but i have favourites that i enjoyed reading
                or watching enough to remember. I'm going to list the books first
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Books</th>
                    <th>Authors</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>The Vampire Assistant</td>
                    <td>Darren Shan</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Alex Rider</td>
                    <td>Anthony Horosw</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h4>The Vampire Assistant : </h4>
            <p>
                Darren Shan : to be continued later when i'm ready
